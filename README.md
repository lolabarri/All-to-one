# All-to-one

This is my first web application, and my second project for Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp.

In my family we are eleven brothers and sisters, and we all share one car! We are very nice to each other, so this is usually not a problem BUUUUT... what do you do when a traffic ticket arrives? How do you know who was driving the car that day?

All to one wants to solve this problem. You only have to signup, choose a car, press "Start trip" and everything done! The application will register at what time you pressed the Start button, and when you press the Stop button, it will save the time and position of the car. So now there is no problem paying our tickets.
